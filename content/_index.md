Welcome to the Advanced Light Emitting and Imaging Materials (ALEIM) Lab at Zhejiang University. Rooted in the principles of molecular interactions, our lab is dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of illumination phenomena and their chemical functions, with a special focus on designing and synthesizing novel photoluminescent materials for cutting-edge applications in lighting, biosensing, and biomedical imaging. 

Led by Assistant Professor Shi-Yuan Zhang, our research leverages innovative molecular and nanoscale material design to develop customizable luminescent materials with target emission properties. Nestled at the crossroads of chemistry, materials science, photonics, and nanotechnology, our lab is a beacon of creativity and collaboration to tailor our materials for integration into functional devices and systems.

Unveiling the Invisible: Illuminating Possibilities

At the heart of our lab lies the passion for understanding the intricate molecular interactions behind luminescent materials. Through meticulous manipulation of molecular structures and compositions, we delve into the fundamental mechanisms that govern light emission, pushing the boundaries of what is possible. From designing novel luminescent compounds to engineering sophisticated imaging probes, we strive to unveil the invisible and transform it into tangible innovations.

Our Mission: Bridging Discovery and Application

Our mission is twofold: to advance fundamental knowledge in the field of functional light emitting and imaging materials and to translate this knowledge into real-world solutions. From metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to halide perovskites and beyond, we synthesize materials that possess the unique ability to emit light, respond to external stimuli, and hold promise in various imaging applications. By fostering a holistic approach that integrates theory, experimentation, and technological development, we bridge the gap between discovery and application, catalyzing advancements across a spectrum of industries.

Join the Light: An Invitation to Collaborate

We extend an invitation to chemists, material scientists, engineers, and seekers of knowledge to embark on this illuminating journey with us. In the ALEIM Lab, chemistry converges with the brilliance of light, paving the way for discoveries that will shape the future. Welcome to a laboratory where molecules and photons dance in harmony, forging a path towards innovation and enlightenment.
